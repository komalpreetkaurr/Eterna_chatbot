# Eterna Chatbot

Welcome to the **Eterna Chatbot** project! This repository contains the source code for the Eterna Chatbot, an intelligent conversational agent designed to assist users in various tasks, answer questions, and engage in meaningful dialogue.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Eterna uses advanced NLP techniques to understand and generate human-like responses.
- **Context Awareness:** The chatbot can maintain conversation context, making it suitable for continuous dialogues and complex queries.
- **Multitasking:** Capable of handling multiple topics and switching between them without losing track.
- **Customization:** Easily customizable to meet specific use cases, from casual conversations to more specialized tasks.
- **Integration Support:** Can be integrated with websites, applications, and other platforms.

## Installation

To get started with Eterna Chatbot, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.8)
- pip (Python package manager)
- Node.js (>= 14.0) for frontend development (if applicable)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eterna-chatbot.git
cd eterna-chatbot
```

### Install Backend Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Frontend Dependencies

If you're running a frontend interface, navigate to the `frontend/` directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Configuration

Before running the chatbot, you may need to configure certain parameters like API keys, database connections, or environment variables. Check the `.env.example` file and create a `.env` file with your credentials.

### Running the Backend (Chatbot Server)

Once the backend is set up, you can start the chatbot server with:

```bash
python run_chatbot.py
```

This will start the chatbot server, and it will listen for incoming requests from the frontend or any other client.

### Running the Frontend (Web Interface)

To open the chatbot in a browser-based interface, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the backend server is running (see the previous step).
2. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and start the local development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the Eterna Chatbot interface where you can interact with the bot.

## Usage

Once the chatbot is running (via backend or full application), you can interact with it in various ways, such as:

- **Text-based interaction:** Ask the bot questions or give it commands, and it will respond with appropriate answers.
- **Voice integration:** With additional configuration, you can enable voice input/output using libraries like SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3.

## Customization

You can easily modify the bot's behavior by adjusting the following:

1. **Conversation Modules:** Add or modify conversation handlers in the `conversations` directory.
2. **Response Generation:** Change how the bot responds by tweaking the response templates in the `responses` module.
3. **Third-party Integrations:** Add new integrations with external services by modifying the `integrations` folder.
